/// It is a reimplementation of Swift `lazy` modifier using a property wrapper.
/// As an extra on top of `lazy` it offers reseting the wrapper to its "uninitialized" state.

/// Usage:
/// ```
/// @LazyAtomic var result = expensiveOperation()
/// ...
/// print(result) // expensiveOperation() is executed at this point
/// ```
